# Tab targeting, screenshot budget and frame coverage

**Date:** 2026-09-11
**Status:** approved design, not yet implemented
**Scope:** pass 1 of 2. Pass 2 (the seven missing tools and the wider permission
surface) is deliberately excluded and listed at the end.

## Problem

Three defects in the existing 21 tools, found by reading the installed Claude in
Chrome extension (v1.0.91, `fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn`) and comparing it
against this one.

1. **Implicit tab targeting is unsafe.** `resolveTabId`
   (`extension/service-worker.js:111`) falls back to
   `chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true })`, so any command
   sent without a `tabId` acts on **whatever tab the user is currently looking
   at**. `chrome_click { ref: 7 }` can click in the user's bank tab.
2. **A full-page screenshot can be a multi-megabyte frame.** The capture is
   unconditional PNG and crosses the bridge as base64 with no size guard.
3. **Frames are invisible.** `snapshot`, `find` and every ref resolution run in
   the main frame's execution context only, so any page whose content lives in an
   `iframe` reads as empty.

## Scope

**In:** tab targeting (A), screenshot budget (B), frame coverage (C), and a
documented remote-access path (D).

**Out:** the consent/permission layer (excluded by explicit decision); the seven
missing tools (`form_input`, `gif_creator`, `shortcuts_list`,
`shortcuts_execute`, `update_plan`, `file_upload`, browser switching); the
wider manifest permission surface; a hosted relay.

## A — Tab targeting

### Contract

`resolveTabId(tabId)` becomes:

| Input | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| a number | use it; record it as the current tab; the confinement check below still applies |
| absent, and a current tab is recorded | use the recorded tab |
| absent, and none is recorded | throw `no tab yet — call chrome_open first, or pass an explicit tabId` |

The `lastFocusedWindow` active-tab fallback is **deleted**. Guessing is replaced
by either explicit intent or a recorded one.

### State

`currentTabId` is written by:

- `chrome_open` on both paths (the `newTab` path and the existing-tab path);
- every command that receives an explicit numeric `tabId`.

It is persisted in `chrome.storage.session` so a service-worker restart does not
lose it, and it is cleared by the existing `chrome.tabs.onRemoved` listener
(`service-worker.js:247`, which already clears `attached`, `cursorAt`,
`consoleByTab` and `networkByTab`).

### Confinement

A new boolean setting `confineToAgentTabs`, stored in `chrome.storage.local`,
**default `false`**, toggled from the options page.

When it is on, a `tabId` whose `chrome.tabs.get` result has
`groupId !== agentGroupId` is refused with:

> Tab N is not in the agent's tab group for this session. Tools can only target
> tabs inside the group; call chrome_tabs to list the tabs the agent may use.

### Deviation from Claude, stated deliberately

Claude confines unconditionally: every tool refuses a tab outside its own group.
This plugin exists to drive the tabs the user is **already signed in to**, so
unconditional confinement would defeat its purpose. We keep the capability and
remove the accident: the default target is the agent's own tab, and reaching the
user's tabs requires naming one. `confineToAgentTabs` restores Claude's
guarantee for anyone who wants it.

### Tool-facing changes

- The `tabId` description on every tool that has one changes from *"Defaults to
  the active tab"* to *"Defaults to the tab the agent is working in — the last one
  it opened or was given. Pass an explicit id to work on another tab."*
- `chrome_tabs` entries gain `agent: true|false`, true when the tab is in the
  agent's group, so the model can tell its own tabs from the user's.
- `chrome_open`'s description states that it also sets the current tab.

---

## B — Screenshot budget

### Why this is smaller than it first appeared

`chrome_screenshot` returns `{ path, bytes }` to the model, not pixels: the model
receives a **file path** and must call `read_image`, which the harness downscales
before anything reaches the model. Claude's `MAX_BASE64_CHARS = 1398100` JPEG
budget governs a different budget from ours, so matching it would be parity on
paper only. The real cost here is a large base64 frame crossing the loopback
socket.

### Change

One guard, in the extension's `screenshot` command (`service-worker.js:1077`):

1. Capture PNG as today. If `data.length` is at most
   `SCREENSHOT_BASE64_LIMIT = 2_000_000`, return it.
2. Otherwise re-capture as JPEG, stepping CDP's `quality` parameter (0–100)
   through `90, 75, 60, 45, 30`, and return the first result that fits.
3. If none fits, return the smallest produced. If no JPEG was produced at all
   (every attempt was refused or returned no data), keep the oversized PNG and
   return it with `format: 'png'` — an oversized image is still usable, and
   turning a size problem into a failure would be worse.
4. The command returns `{ base64, format }` where `format` is `'png'` or
   `'jpeg'`.

The host's `captureScreenshot` (`src/index.ts:313`) uses `format` to pick the
file extension. Today the default path is always `.png`; it becomes `.png` or
`.jpg` to match the bytes actually written. An explicit `savePath` is still
honoured verbatim, because the caller asked for that exact path.

## C — Frame coverage

### Enumeration

`Page.getFrameTree` walks the frame tree. Each **child** frame gets an execution
context from `Page.createIsolatedWorld({ frameId, worldName:
'dsh-agent-snapshot' })`, and the snapshot expression is evaluated there with
`Runtime.evaluate({ expression, contextId, returnByValue: true })`. The **main**
frame is deliberately left in the page's own world instead: the snapshot parks its
refs in `window.__dshChromeRefs`, and every ref consumer (click, type, scroll,
hover, upload, drag) resolves them through the page's own context, so reading the
main frame in an isolated world would leave every main-frame ref unreachable. That
was a Critical fix during implementation, and this record matches the shipped
code. An isolated world is used for child frames so a page that redefines globals
cannot break the walk, and CDP is not subject to same-origin, so cross-origin
frames work.

At most **12 frames** are read; the rest are reported as
`… N further frames not read`.

### Ref encoding

Frames are keyed `f0` (main), `f1`, `f2`… in tree order, and the key travels as
its **own optional argument** rather than folded into the ref.

The main frame keeps writing `[ref=7] button "Submit"`. A child frame writes
`[ref=7 frame=f1] button "Submit"`. `ref` stays an **integer**; `frame` is the
new optional string argument, accepted by `chrome_click`, `chrome_hover`,
`chrome_type`, `chrome_scroll` and `chrome_upload`, and as `fromFrame`/`toFrame`
on `chrome_drag`.

- **Existing calls are untouched.** No `frame` means the main frame, so every
  current snapshot line, prompt and test keeps working.
- Why not `f1:7` as a string ref: the page-side resolver
  (`pointExpressionFor`, `extension/service-worker.js:456`) and every host tool
  schema type `ref` as an integer. Folding the frame into the ref would mean
  widening `ref` to `string|number`, losing its validation and adding a parse to
  every ref-using tool. A sibling argument costs one optional field and keeps the
  existing type.

### Clicking a ref that lives inside a frame

This is the part that must not be got wrong, and it is not free.

`getBoundingClientRect` inside a frame is relative to **that frame's** viewport,
not the top-level page, and CDP mouse events take top-level viewport coordinates.
A ref from a frame therefore needs its offset accumulated up the tree: for each
ancestor frame, `DOM.getFrameOwner({ frameId })` gives the frame's element, and
`DOM.getBoxModel` gives that element's box in its own parent. Summing the chain
yields the frame element's position in the top frame's **document** space.
`DOM.getBoxModel` is scroll-unadjusted, so that sum is *not* yet viewport space:
the top frame's own `window.scrollX`/`window.scrollY` is subtracted once per
resolution (`framePointToViewport`) before the point is dispatched. Only the top
frame's scroll applies at any nesting depth — each level's box is already in its
parent's document space, and the deepest point comes from
`getBoundingClientRect`, so the frames between cancel out. Reading the sum as
viewport space is correct only while the top page is unscrolled, and that
assumption was the bug. `DOM.enable` is already on (`ensureAttached`,
`service-worker.js:126`).

The frame element can itself be scrolled out of the top page's viewport.
`scrollIntoView` inside the frame scrolls the frame's own content, never the
frame element in the top page, so each ancestor frame is resolved to a JS object
(`DOM.resolveNode`) and scrolled with `scrollIntoView` — outermost first, so an
inner frame is only scrolled once the frame that holds it is visible. Because
the box quads are scroll-unadjusted, which ancestor is in view does not change
them; the scroll is what makes the final viewport point land on screen. Resolving
or scrolling an owner that fails throws rather than being swallowed: a frame that
cannot be brought into view must refuse, never dispatch. `DOM.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded`
was tried first and silently no-oped on a frame owner, which is how the frame
stayed off-screen while the click was dispatched anyway.

If any offset in the chain cannot be determined (the frame's owner element is
`display: none`, or an ancestor has no box model), the command **fails with a
named error rather than clicking at a guessed position**. Clicking the wrong place
is worse than not clicking.

### find fan-out

`chrome_find` runs in every frame context and merges the results; matches from a
child frame are labelled `[f1]` so a hit's location is answerable. Nobody hunts for text and wants it
only if it happens to be in the main document.

`chrome_page_text` **stays main-frame only** by decision: its job is reading the
article, and frame text is usually widget and banner noise.

### Caps

Frame count is capped at 12. The snapshot's existing text budget is unchanged.
Nested frames are read in tree order, so the cap degrades predictably.

## D — Remote access (documentation only)

No relay is built. The bridge stays bound to `127.0.0.1` and the pinned
`Origin` check remains the only authentication, which is only sound because the
socket is unreachable from anywhere else. Reaching a browser on another machine is
an SSH tunnel, documented in `README.md` as a short recipe.

---

## The interface pass 2 is written against

Pass 2 adds seven tools. Each of them calls `resolveTabId`, so this pass
establishes, once:

1. a command with no `tabId` targets the recorded tab or fails loudly — never a
   guess;
2. a command with a `tabId` respects `confineToAgentTabs`;
3. a command that reads the page reads every frame it should.

## Testing

**Hermetic** (`npm test`, no browser). The pure helpers move to
`extension/pure.js`, loaded by the classic service worker with `importScripts`
(permitted in MV3 service workers that are not modules) and by the node test
directly, so there is one implementation and no `chrome.*` dependency:

- `flattenFrameTree`: tree order, main frame first, each child carrying its
  parent's key, and the total reported even when the list is capped.
- `normaliseFrameKey`: absent, `''`, `null` and `f0` all mean the main frame;
  `f1` and `f12` pass; `1`, `fx` and `f0a` are rejected.
- the quality ladder: `nextJpegQuality` walks down and stops; `chooseJpegAttempt`
  picks the first JPEG that fits (even when a later one is smaller), the smallest
  when none fits, and null when every attempt produced nothing.
- the confinement predicate: an agent-group tab passes, a foreign tab is refused,
  and `confineToAgentTabs: false` admits both.

**Live** (`node test/live-extension.mjs`, real Chrome). Appended checks:

- with no recorded tab, a command without `tabId` fails with the named error
  rather than touching the user's active tab — the regression this pass exists for;
- after `chrome_open`, a command without `tabId` acts on the agent's tab while a
  **different** tab is the user's active one;
- `chrome_tabs` marks the agent's tab `agent: true` and the user's `false`;
- against a fixture page with an offset `srcdoc` iframe, the snapshot contains a
  ref from the frame, and clicking it lands on the frame's element with the offset
  applied;
- `chrome_find` finds text that exists only inside the iframe;
- a screenshot reports a `format`, and the written file's extension matches it.

**Manual:** the `confineToAgentTabs` toggle exercised from the options page
against a user tab. A storage-driven setting cannot be flipped from the live
suite without a test-only command, which is not worth adding.

## Files touched

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `extension/pure.js` | new: ref encoding, quality ladder, confinement predicate |
| `extension/service-worker.js` | `importScripts`; `resolveTabId` rewrite; `currentTabId` state; confinement check; screenshot format and guard; frame enumeration, ref parsing, offset accumulation; `find` fan-out |
| `extension/options.html`, `extension/options.js` | the `confineToAgentTabs` toggle |
| `src/index.ts` | `tabId` descriptions; `chrome_tabs` `agent` flag; screenshot format to file extension |
| `test/pure.test.mjs` | hermetic tests for the pure helpers |
| `test/live-extension.mjs` | the live checks above |
| `README.md` | the new default, the setting, the SSH tunnel recipe |

## Rejected alternatives

| Alternative | Why not |
|---|---|
| Claude-exact unconditional confinement | defeats the plugin's purpose; kept as an opt-in setting instead |
| Requiring `tabId` on every call | safe, but every call and every batch step becomes verbose for no extra safety over a recorded tab |
| Full Claude-parity JPEG ladder with a 1398100-char cap | governs a context budget we do not share; the model gets a path, not pixels |
| Doing nothing about screenshot size | leaves a pathological multi-page PNG as a multi-megabyte bridge frame |
| Fanning `page_text` out across frames | mixes banner and widget text into the article the model is reading |
| Guessing a frame's offset when its owner has no box model | a wrong click is worse than a refused one |
| A hosted WSS relay | new public attack surface to serve a case that an SSH tunnel already covers |

## Risks and limits

- Clicking a ref inside a frame depends on `DOM.getFrameOwner`, `DOM.resolveNode`
  and `DOM.getBoxModel` succeeding for every ancestor, and on the owner scrolling
  into view; when they do not, the click is refused rather than approximated. The
  conversion from document space to viewport space needs the top frame's scroll —
  a scrolled descendant tab with a still top frame is the case a test must cover.
- The 12-frame cap means the very deepest content on a frame-heavy page is not
  read. Tree order makes what is skipped predictable.
- `importScripts` keeps the service worker classic. Converting it to an ES module
  would also work but changes how it loads, which this pass does not need.
- A ref taken before the page navigates or the frame tree changes remains stale,
  exactly as a main-frame ref does today. The existing advice — take a fresh
  snapshot — still applies.
