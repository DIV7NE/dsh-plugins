# dsh-chrome-agent

A DeepSeek Harness plugin that gives the agent your **real, logged-in Chrome**:
its tabs, its cookies, its sessions. The agent reads pages as annotated text,
clicks, types, presses keys, runs JavaScript, and takes screenshots — all in the
browser you already have open.

## Why not a second browser, or a debugging port

The obvious design — point a headless browser at a copy of your Chrome profile —
does not work, and the reason is worth stating because it is not a bug:

| Approach | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Copy the profile | Chrome seals cookies with a key bound to the original profile **path** (app-bound encryption). Byte-identical files still do not decrypt: a copied `Network\Cookies` of exactly 1,638,400 bytes still required sign-in everywhere. |
| Share the live profile | Chrome takes an exclusive lock on `User Data`; a second Chrome cannot start against it. |
| `--remote-debugging-port` | Needs Chrome restarted with the flag, and hands the agent whole-browser control with no consent boundary. |
| **Extension + `chrome.debugger`** | Runs *inside* the trust boundary, so there is nothing to defeat. This is what Claude in Chrome does. |

## Install

### 1. The plugin

This plugin lives in the [dsh-plugins](https://github.com/DIV7NE/dsh-plugins)
monorepo, in its own directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DIV7NE/dsh-plugins
cd dsh-plugins/dsh-chrome-agent
npm install
npm run install:profile          # builds, packs, installs into the web profile
```

**Restart the DSH server** (`dsh web`) — the profile's bundle stack is composed
at boot, so a new plugin cannot appear in a running server. Reload the page.

A note for anyone packaging this plugin from outside: it is a directory inside a
repository, and `dsh plugin add <repo>` resolves the **repository root**, not a
subdirectory. A monorepo package is therefore installed from its own directory
(the commands above) or from a marketplace catalog entry that names its
`manifestPath`; there is no `dsh plugin add` spec that addresses a subdirectory.

### 2. The companion extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right)
3. **Load unpacked** → select this package's `extension/` folder
4. Open the extension's **Options** and check the DSH web port (default `3080`)

Chrome shows *"DSH Chrome Agent started debugging this browser"* while the agent
holds an attachment. That banner is Chrome's, and it is the honest signal that
the agent can see your tabs.

### 3. Check it

Ask the agent to run `chrome_status`. It should report the extension connected,
with the same extension id the options page shows.

### Sharing the extension with someone else

There is no Chrome Web Store listing, and none is needed: the manifest carries a
fixed `key`, so Chrome derives this extension's id from that key rather than
from the folder it was loaded out of. An unpacked install therefore gets the
**same id** the DSH server expects, and is a first-class install rather than a
degraded one. Move or rename the folder and the id does not change.

Send them the repository (or a release zip), and they run the same four steps
above. What they take on:

| Trade-off | Detail |
|---|---|
| No automatic updates | Chrome never updates an unpacked extension. Re-download and click **Reload** in `chrome://extensions`. |
| Developer mode required | A dismissible "Disable developer mode extensions" prompt appears on startup. |
| No store discovery | There is nothing to search for; the link is how it spreads. |

To cut a shareable zip, `npm run pack:webstore` writes
`dsh-chrome-agent-webstore.zip` — the extension at the zip root, with no
sources, tests, or `node_modules`. Unzip it and point **Load unpacked** at the
resulting folder. See [SHARING-WITHOUT-STORE.md](SHARING-WITHOUT-STORE.md) for
the full picture, and [STORE-LISTING.md](STORE-LISTING.md) if you later decide
to pay the one-time Chrome Web Store fee.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `chrome_status` | Is the extension connected, and which build. |
| `chrome_tabs` | Every open tab: id, title, url, which is active, and whether it is the agent's own (`agent: true|false`). |
| `chrome_open` | Navigate a tab, or open a new one. |
| `chrome_snapshot` | The page as a text tree of interactive elements, each with `[ref=N]`. |
| `chrome_click` | Click by `ref`, CSS selector, or coordinates. Brings the tab to the front first. |
| `chrome_type` | Type into an element (or the focused one); optional Enter. |
| `chrome_key` | One key or chord, e.g. `Enter`, `PageDown`, `Control+a`. Brings the tab to the front first. |
| `chrome_eval` | Evaluate JavaScript in the page. |
| `chrome_screenshot` | The visible area, saved to a path: PNG, or JPEG when the capture is large enough to need re-encoding. The result reports which format it encoded. |

The loop is the same one every browser agent uses: `chrome_snapshot`, then act on
a ref. **A ref is only valid until the next snapshot** — the page re-numbers them.

### Frames

Snapshots read `iframe`s as well as the top page. A ref from inside a frame is
written `[ref=7 frame=f1]`, and it has to be passed back with `frame: "f1"` — a
ref with no frame means the main page, so every existing call is unchanged at the
price of one optional argument. `chrome_find` searches every frame and labels a
hit from inside a frame, but `chrome_page_text` stays main-page only, because
frame text is usually widget and banner noise. At most **12 frames** are read; a
snapshot or a find reports how many further frames it did not read, and which
frames it could not read at all.

## It works in the background

Every tab the agent opens lands in a **tab group called "DSH Chrome Agent"**, and
opening one **does not move your view**: the tab is created inactive and loads in
the background. You can collapse the group and forget it, or open it to watch.
Closing the group closes the agent's work; your own tabs are untouched.

Reads stay in the background too. Snapshots, evaluations, text, network and
console all work on a tab without bringing it forward, and screenshots follow the
same rule — the agent sees a background tab without bringing it forward. Only if
a background capture genuinely cannot be produced does it fall back to activating
the tab, which is a last resort rather than the default. A tab Chrome has
discarded to save memory is reloaded first, because a discarded tab has no
renderer to capture.

Sending input is the exception. Chrome routes neither keys nor mouse events to a
tab that is not visible, so `chrome_key`, `chrome_click`, `chrome_hover` and
`chrome_drag` bring the agent's tab to the front for the moment they act, which
moves your view there — but only when nothing is being composited for that tab:
a window that is merely behind another app is left exactly where it is, and the
click still lands. `chrome_scroll` does not move your view: scrolling falls
back to a scripted scroll. `chrome_type` does not either, unless you set
`submit` — the Enter it then presses is a key event, and keys need a visible tab.

### Which tab a command acts on

A command sent without a `tabId` acts on the tab the agent is working in — the
last one it opened or was given. There is no "whichever tab you are looking at"
default: that fallback is gone. With no tab yet, such a command fails with
`no tab yet — call chrome_open first, or pass an explicit tabId`, rather than
touching the tab on your screen.

To have the agent work on a tab **you** opened, name it: the model passes that
tab's id, or you point it at one with `chrome_tabs`. Each entry there is marked
`agent: true|false`, so the agent can tell its own tabs from yours.

The options page's **Only work in the agent's own tabs** switch confines every
command to the group the agent opened. It is **off by default**, because the whole
point of this plugin is driving the tabs you are already signed in to; with it on,
a command naming one of your tabs is refused instead.

### Why input needs a visible tab

Chrome gives a tab that is not visible no focused frame and drops input before it
reaches the page. Measured: `Control+a` on a background tab produced **zero**
`keydown` events and left the selection empty; a main-frame click and a click on
a frame ref each fired nothing on a background tab, while the same click fired on
a visible one. There is no CDP flag that changes this, so `chrome_key`,
`chrome_click`, `chrome_hover` and `chrome_drag` bring their tab forward first.

Visible means the tab **and** its window. A tab stays active inside a window that
is behind another app, and Chrome composites nothing for a window nobody is
showing, so `document.visibilityState` reads `hidden` there too — and that case
is not merely a dropped event: every mouse event stalls for about five seconds
before it lands. Measured on one tab, same click: window behind another app,
5007ms; window in front, 66ms. A key event skipped the stall entirely at 4ms,
which points at the compositor's hit test rather than at input as a whole. Focus
is not what input needs, though: with the window visible but behind another app
the click landed in 331ms without the window ever being focused, so focus is
taken only when the page reports it is not visible.

Text entry is unaffected, because `Input.insertText` takes a different path and
works on a background tab; scrolling falls back to a scripted `window.scrollBy`,
so it too stays in the background. A `chrome_type` with `submit` set is the
exception: the Enter it presses is a key event, so that call brings the tab
forward first.

## Security

The bridge hands over a browser, so it is fenced:

- **The extension id is pinned.** The manifest carries a fixed public `key`, so
  Chrome derives the same 32-character id on every machine that loads this
  folder. The server computes that id from the same key and accepts a handshake
  only from `chrome-extension://<that id>`.
- **`Origin` is set by the browser and cannot be forged by page script**, which
  is what makes the check an authentication rather than a hint. A web page —
  including one served from localhost — presents an `http(s)` origin and is
  refused. Another extension presents its own id and is refused.
- This is a browser-driving capability, not a shell: it can do what you could do
  with DevTools open on any tab, and nothing more.

### Reaching a browser on another machine

The bridge listens on the loopback interface only, and the pinned-origin check is
the authentication precisely because the socket is not reachable from anywhere
else. To drive a Chrome on another machine, forward the port over SSH:

```bash
ssh -N -L 3080:127.0.0.1:3080 user@the-other-machine
```

DSH, the extension and its options port all then live on the same machine as
before: the extension still dials `127.0.0.1:3080`, and neither it nor the options
page knows the tunnel exists.

## Configuration

```yaml
- id: chrome-agent
  name: 'dsh-chrome-agent'
```

The extension's port lives in its own options page, not in this file — the
extension is what dials out, so that is where the address belongs.

## Known limitations

- **One debugger client per tab.** If DevTools is open on a tab, or another
  extension has attached, commands on that tab fail with a clear message.
- **Refs are snapshot-scoped.** Re-snapshot after anything that changes the DOM.
- **Text entry uses `Input.insertText`.** Fine for forms and search boxes; a page
  that needs per-keystroke events (some typeaheads) may need a follow-up.
- **The screenshot is the visible viewport**, not a full-page capture.
- **An `alert()` is dismissed automatically.** A dialog owns the renderer's main
  thread, so leaving one open is indistinguishable from a hung tab.
- **Unpacked only.** Chrome will not install an unpublished `.crx`, so this loads
  in Developer mode. `--load-extension` no longer works either: Chrome 153 ignores
  it, which is why the extension is loaded by hand.

## Development

```sh
npm run build          # esbuild: lib/index.js only; the extension needs no build
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm test               # hermetic: id derivation + the Origin fence
node test/live-extension.mjs [port]   # drives a real Chrome (see its header)
```
